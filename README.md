# PercentageVote - inclusive Budgeting
Utilize Standing Distributions for a combined "Vote" allowing for equal input from all participants.

## Fairly combining all participant's point of view
Standing distributions are defined as a list of percentages that aggregate to 100%. They can be leveraged in interesting ways, one of which is for how to fairly take into account everyone's input, across a multitude of choices.

There are many circumstances where a need to capture nuanced point of view and combine them together to arrive at an outcome. For example, deciding upon a budget. For illustrative purposes, the PercentageVote spreadsheet does just this, allowing for all participating "Senators" to decide where the budget should be directed. They do this by allocating "100%" of their Voting choice across the given budget categories.

The spreadsheet then aggregates across all Senators votes, and arrives at a specific dollar amount for a respective budget category.

## Voting
Or in this case, budgeting. The spreadsheet's total amount to be budgeted is set in the top left column. Senators allocate how much they wish to be budgeted to a particular category by setting a percentage what percentage of the budget should go for that category. The spreadsheet then averages each budget category across all Senators to arrive at a final percentage, and this final percentage is what is then applied to obtain what dollar amount from the overall budget will be allocated.

## Adding more choices
To customize the spreadsheet, rename the budget categories at will. Delete unused Budget Categories or Senators. To add more Budget Categories copy the last budget category row, and paste it below, and rename it to suite your needs. To add more Senators, Copy the last Sentator Column, and paste it to the right.

By following this pattern, the spreadsheet will be able to maintain the proper counts of total Budget Categories, and total Senators, which will ensure correct aggregations.

## Example Use
In the Two Screenshots below, the vote begins with an empty slate. As Senators vote, their Availble to Allocate decreases from 100%, and their Total % Allocated increases until it becomes 100%.
In the second Screenshot, "Senator G" has 22% remaining to be allocated, and she can distribute it across any of the given choices, and is finished when 100% Allocate is reached.
